## FAQ

**Q: Can other people's thoughts control my remote?**
A: Each remote is calibrated to individual brainwave patterns. However, identical
twins may experience cross-interference.

**Q: What if I have intrusive thoughts?**
A: The remote filters out non-intentional thoughts. Random TV channel changes
occur in less than 3% of users.

**Q: Does it work while I'm sleeping?**
A: Sleep mode automatically disables thought control. Dreams will not trigger commands.

## Warning

- Do not use while under the influence of intense emotions
- Keep away from mind readers and telepaths
- May cause confusion about whether you actually pressed a button or just thought about it
- Not recommended for use during arguments (may lead to aggressive channel changing)
